# Game-of-Life
 Conway's game of life in python
 The rules of the game of life are: 
 1. Any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbors becomes dead, because of under population
 2. Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive, because its neighborhood is just right
 3. Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors becomes dead, because of overpopulation
 4. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive, by reproduction
